Guide for getting Skyrim SE 1.6.117 set up for Skyrim Together from scratch, with a few adjustments. The provided guide is very well documented, but I want to specify that using MO2 is much easier, and add a few mods to make it more fun and hopefully not crash.

1. Install the prerequisites listed in [Skyrim Together Reborn - client setup](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online/guides/client-setup)
2. While that is downloading, [install & set up Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) following this guide.](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online/guides/client-setup/using-modorganizer2-mo2/installing-modorganizer2/installating-the-mod-manager).
3. [Address Library for SKSE](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online/guides/client-setup/using-modorganizer2-mo2/utilities) is a required mod. Install that also using MO2.
4. Disable Creation Club and Anniversary Upgrade according to the instructions in the guide.
5. [Install & test Skyrim Together.](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online/guides/client-setup/using-modorganizer2-mo2/skyrim-together-reborn)\
   (I am trying to see if [Alternate Start - Live Another Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272) can be used to bypass the Helgen intro quest and connect to a server immediately.)

Upon completing the "Using Mod Organizer" section and installing Skyrim Together in the guide and connecting to a test server, we should be able to play.

### Additional mods
Enhance gameplay, quality of life, and character creation.
Always check the prerequisites when installing mods, or they will not work.
1. [SKSE64](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379?tab=files) - Script extender, necessary for many mods. See installation instructions on mod page.
2. [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604)
3. [Racemenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080)
4. [KS Hairdos](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6817)
5. [Alternate Start - Live Another Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272) Skips super long Helgen intro, prerequisite is USSEP
6. Untested, don't install yet: [BEASTHHBB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38480)
7. Skin mods: Tempered Skin for [male](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7902) and [female (NSFW)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8505) characters is a good choice for wide compatibility. Select Vanilla option.
   Personally, I use [Skysight Skins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6580) for men. For women, I use [Mature Skin 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26017?tab=description) (Actually I overwrite it with skin textures from [Real Girls CBBE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75065). Choose vanilla options.
8. UNTESTED, DON'T INSTALL: [Latest ENB binaries](http://enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrimse_v0502.htm) (scroll down to download) and [ENB]() if your PC can handle it. 
Notes: 
- As long as there is no plugin, texture and mesh mods might work fine. In the folder of the mod, there should be no .esp or .esl file. Feel free to install these, hopefully they will work.
